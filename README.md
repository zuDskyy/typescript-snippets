# typescript-snippets

 Open VS Code:
Launch Visual Studio Code on your computer.

Access User Snippets:
In VS Code, go to the "File" menu and select "Preferences," then choose "User Snippets." Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Shift + P (macOS), and then type "User Snippets."

Select the Language:
You'll be prompted to select the language for which you want to add a snippet. In this case, choose "TypeScript" or "JavaScript" if your TypeScript code is similar to JavaScript.

Create a New Snippet File:
If you already have a .json file for TypeScript snippets, you can open it; otherwise, you can create a new one. If you need to create a new snippet file, VS Code will prompt you to choose a file name and location. Name it something like typescript.json.

Define Your TypeScript Code Snippet:
In the JSON file, define your TypeScript snippet. Here's an example of a simple TypeScript snippet for a function:

json
Copy code
````javascipt
{
  "TypeScript Function": {
    "prefix": "tsfunction",
    "body": [
      "function functionName() {",
      "  // Your code here",
      "}"
    ],
    "description": "Create a TypeScript function"
  }
}
````
In this example:

"TypeScript Function" is the name of the snippet.
"prefix" is a short keyword you can type in your code to trigger the snippet.
"body" contains the actual code that will be inserted when the snippet is triggered.
"description" is a short description of the snippet.
Save the Snippet File:
Save the JSON file once you've defined your TypeScript snippet.

Use the TypeScript Snippet:
To use your TypeScript snippet, open a TypeScript file in VS Code, type the snippet's prefix (e.g., tsfunction in our example), and you should see an IntelliSense suggestion to insert the snippet. Press Tab or Enter to insert the code
